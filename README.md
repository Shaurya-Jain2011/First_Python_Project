# First_Python_Project
My first python project. A password strength checker and a strong password generator.




Awesome work, Shaurya! That's a great first project â€” clear logic, good use of Python basics, and very useful too. Here's a ready-to-use `README.md` for your project:

* `if`/`else` logic
* Loops
* String methods
* `random` and `string` modules
* Python functions

```

4. Follow the prompts:

   * Enter a password to check
   * Optionally generate a new strong password

What I Learned

* How to use string operations like `.isupper()`, `.islower()`
* Using `any()` with conditions

This is my first project and This README file has been written totally by ChatGPT because I, Shaurya Jain don't know what is to be written in a README file but the whole code has been written by me. Thank you!
